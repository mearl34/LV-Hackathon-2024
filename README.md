## About our Project
A common problem plaguing many college students is finding food that fits with dietary restrictions. Students who must follow vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, kosher, or halal diets, for any reason, have a much more difficult experience trying to find food on campus. We decided to provide an aid to these students to help them find possible options to eat considering both what they're in the mood for and also their personal dietary needs/restrictions.
